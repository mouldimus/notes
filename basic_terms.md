## High Level Language:
A Computer programming language that is designed to be simple for people to read and write. 

**For Example,**
> `print "Hello"`

(You are telling the computer to write out the word "Hello")

## Low level language:
A programming language that is easy for a computer to understand. This is called a low level language because it is brought close down to the computers level of understanding. A person attempting to read a low level language may become confused because the lower the language , the less it is like english.

**Example,**
> `MOV AL, 61h`

Here you are telling the computer to put a number in a specific location in the computers memory.

## Scripting:
Scripting is when creating a series of commands that cause your computer to automatically perform actions. Just how an actor follows a script, a computer follows a list of commands - this is called a script.

**Example,**

You can use scripting to make a web page automatically play a video when people go to that page.

## Scripting language:

A scripting language is a programming language used to make scripts.

## Complier:

When you write code to make a program, you usually write in a form that looks almost like english. For example it might look like:

> `if age > 18 then print "You are an adult"`

Computers can't understand language like that, so that code would have to be changed into a form that the computer does understand.

A complier is a special program that converts the code from a high level language, into a low level language.

## IDE - Integrated Development Environment
An IDE is a set of programming tools for writing software programs. IDEs are a great aid to software development. An IDE often combines many available tools into one place - things like a text editor, a complier, a display of the file structure of the files in your software.

**Example,**

Visual Studio Code is a IDE.

## Interpreter:
An interpreter is a program similar to a complier, in that it converts high level language instructions into low level language instructions. The difference between the two is the interpreter performs this action one instruction at a time, rather than converting everything prior to execution.

## Objects:
In the world around you, you are surrounded by objects, a dog, the tv, etc. Objects have state and behavior.
### State
The state of an object would be the condition of its characteristics at any given point in time - its size, colour, etc.

The state of the object may change over time - a balloon, for instance, will not have the same size after a week that it had when it was first inflated. 
### Behavior
The behavior of an object is what the object does, the actions it takes. In our balloon example, possible behaviors could be inflate, deflate and pop.

In programming, objects are parts of computer programs. They share similarity to real life objects: they have state and behavior.

**EXAMPLE:**
an application might work with a customer object.

The state of an object would be the characteristics and attributes of the object at any point in time. The behavior would be what the object could do.

**EXAMPLE:** 

our customer object could have states like active or deleted. It could have behavior like upgrade rewards level or add to family account. Objects are  one of the firsts things you can think about when designing a program.
    
An object could be something on a computer that you can click on, interact with, move around, etc. It could be something behind the scenes that is made up if dae and procedures to manipulate data. An object is what actually runs in the computer.

**EXAMPLE:** 

Let's say you wanted to make two different types of cars on a computer - each car would be an object. Each object (car) would have its own size, shape, colour, speed, distance it could travel without needing more gas, etc.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
There are different approaches you can take to programming. Object-Oriented is an approach to programming that focuses on objects and data (as opposed to actions or some other approach).
    
The first step in OOP, is determining what objects you are going to be dealing with and how all the objects relate to each other. OOP is a popular approach to programming computers that is used in many languages.
    
**EXAMPLE:** 

If you were creating a website using OOP, you would focus on all the things you want included in the website first (pictures,pages,videos,etc.), then design the basic outline of each type of thing, then on from there, always focusing on the data and objects to be used by and contained in the website.

## Python
A programming language created in the late 1980s that has the following characteristics:

1. Its a high level programming language.
2. Python is an OOP language.
3. Python is an interpreted language.
4. Python is a scripting language.
    
Python is considered by many to be one of the easier languages to learn. Python can be used to create apps, programs, websites, games and many other things. It is a very versatile language with many uses.

## IDLE: Intergrated DeveLopment Environment
IDLE is intended to be a simple development environment suitable for beginners, especially in an educational setting.

**EXAMPLE:** 

You can used IDLE to create a Python program.

## Variable:
The name given to a location in a computers memory that a program has set aside for use in storing data, in the situation where the value of the data stored in that memory location may change over time. This is useful because as the value in that memory location changes during the programs executon, the programmer has a name to refer to that memory location by.

**EXAMPLE:**
> `productPrice = 10.99`

Anytime `productPrice` is executed in the program the value `10.99` would show instead. But if later in the program it said
        
> `productPrice = 9.99`

The `prodtuctPrice` variable would then show `9.99` instead.

## Assignment:
This is the action of giving a value to a variable. In some programming languages, you assign a value to a variable using an equal sign (`=`). Your are stating that that variable now has a certain characteristic(s).

## Operator:
The word operator is used to classify the different actions that can be done in mathematics. 

For example `+` and `-` are operators. When new actions are defined in computer science, the symbols used to indicate them are called operators. An operator is a symbol that represents an action.
    
**EXAMPLE:** 

Commands like `AND` and `OR` are considered operators.

## Function:
Worked performed by something. A function is an action taken to get something done. In computers, a function is a command put into a computer that makes the computer complete an exact task or series of tasks. A computer function is a procedure the computer performs. There are thousands of computer functions entered in your computer behind the scenes that instruct your computer on how to operate.
    
`EXAMPLE:` 

When you erase a file on your computer, the file is removed by a delete function.

## String:
A sequence of characters. A string is simply a data type used by computers to represent letters, numbers, words, symbols,etc. 

## Call:
To "call" means to demand or direct something. In programming, a call is a direction by a main program to execute the tasks of a subprogram.
    
**EXAMPLE:**

If someone said, "call your code", that would mean to run the code you have written thus far.

## Operand:
In math, this is the number that is being dealt with in a mathematical operation. It is not the action being taken with the number, it is the number itself.
    
**EXAMPLE:** 

In `5 + 6`, the operands are `5` and `6`; the `+` is the operator.

In computing, an operand is the part of a computer instruction which specifies which data is to be manipulated or operated on. This is the data we are doing something with.

## Elif:
Short for "else if". It literally means, "If something else besides what I mentioned earlier occurs, do this".

## Syntax:
Every spoken language has a general set of rules for how words and sentences should be structured. These rules are known as syntax. In programming its the same thing. Syntax are the rules you must follow when talking to a computer and telling it what to do. (Except the computer can be extremely pedantic about grammar, otherwise the program might not work.)
