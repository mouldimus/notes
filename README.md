### CLI Basics
Overview of Command Line Interface "need to know" words and phrases. 
The text covers various topics related to command-line interface (CLI) commands, file formats, and version control with Git and GitHub. It explains the syntax of CLI commands, the purpose of specific flags for the "curl" command, and differentiates between directories and folders in computers. It also defines INI files, the docx file format, and the "touch" command for updating file date information. The text introduces terms like parsing, case-sensitive programming, hashing, staging, and tracking files in Git. Additionally, it emphasizes the benefits of maintaining a GitHub profile as a development portfolio. Overall, it provides valuable insights for macOS users, developers working with Git, and those interested in organizing their projects using GitHub.

### Git Commands
The basics of Git commands for version control. It covers initializing a repository, listing commands, tracking files, checking status, committing changes, viewing commit history, pushing changes to the main repository, creating and switching branches, merging branches, and the concept of forking repositories. The information provided aims to help users manage and collaborate on projects using Git.

### Internet & Transfer Protocols
An overview of the Internet, protocols, browsers, servers, and clients. It explains that the Internet consists of hardware and protocols for data transmission. It lists various protocols like IP, TCP, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and VOIP. 

### Version Control Basics
Covers various topics related to version control systems, particularly focusing on Git and GitHub. It explains the concept of branches, where developers can work on a copy of the code without affecting the original, and later merge changes back into the main code. It also introduces version control, repository management, and collaboration possibilities. Additionally, it mentions elements of a good README file and provides resources for further information on GitHub READMEs. The text serves as an introductory guide to version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

### Basic Terms
Explains various concepts related to computer programming and programming languages. It covers high-level and low-level languages, scripting, compilers, IDEs, interpreters, objects, object-oriented programming (OOP), Python, variables, assignments, operators, functions, strings, calls, operands, "elif" statement, and syntax. The text provides definitions and examples for each term, aiming to familiarize readers with essential programming concepts and terminology.

### Computer Basics 1
Provides explanations of various computer-related terms and components. It discusses the difference between analog and digital, where analog represents continuous values, while digital represents discrete values. It explains the role of transistors in controlling 1s and 0s in a computer, serving as the basis for how computers function. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is described as the brain of the computer, executing a limited set of actions, and its operations are regulated by a clock. Memory is the temporary storage used by the CPU to store data. The text also introduces the concepts of Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD), which are used for permanent data storage in computers.

### Troubleshooting
Methodology and approaches for developing and troubleshooting programs. It introduces the "Half Split Method," which involves breaking down the work into modules, checking the desired output after each module, and ensuring the correctness of each module before moving on to the next one. If issues arise, it suggests investigating the source, modifications, testing, and further modularizing the problematic module for better analysis. The text also emphasizes the importance of breaking down the program into individual steps that the computer will take, which aids in troubleshooting and testing. It encourages developers to learn from existing systems, ask questions about any concerns, and work on solutions to address identified problems when creating a new program.
