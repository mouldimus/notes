## Troubleshooting
Methodology and approaches for developing and troubleshooting programs. It introduces the "[Half Split Method](./troubleshootin.md#the-half-split-method)," which involves breaking down the work into modules, checking the desired output after each module, and ensuring the correctness of each module before moving on to the next one. If issues arise, it suggests investigating the source, modifications, testing, and further modularizing the problematic module for better analysis. The text also emphasizes the importance of [breaking down the program](./troubleshootin.md#breaking-down-the-program) into individual steps that the computer will take, which aids in troubleshooting and testing. It encourages developers to learn from existing systems, ask questions about any concerns, and work on solutions to address identified problems when creating a new program.
