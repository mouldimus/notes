## Reserved Words and Keywords
[Jump Back](#contents)

In most programming languages, there are certain words you can’t use as variables, labels (names assigned to sections of code), or functions (repeatable blocks of code). These are called reserved words. For example, in the popular programming language Python, `def` (which defines a function) and `if` (which creates an if statement) are reserved words.

The reason you cannot use these words is that they already mean something else – they are reserved for the programming language.

And so, if you were creating a variable in Python, you couldn’t write:
```python
if = 10
```
because `if` already means something in Python.

Reserved words are also called keywords (again, code built into the syntax of a language is the keywords of that language).
