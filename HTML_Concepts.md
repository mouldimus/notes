# HTML Concepts
In here I'll do my best to explain HTML concepts, keywords and phrases.

## Reserved Words and Keywords
[Jump Back](#contents)

In most programming languages, there are certain words you can’t use as variables, labels (names assigned to sections of code), or functions (repeatable blocks of code). These are called reserved words. For example, in the popular programming language Python, `def` (which defines a function) and `if` (which creates an if statement) are reserved words.

The reason you cannot use these words is that they already mean something else – they are reserved for the programming language.

And so, if you were creating a variable in Python, you couldn’t write:
```python
if = 10
```
because `if` already means something in Python.

Reserved words are also called keywords (again, code built into the syntax of a language is the keywords of that language).

## Cache

A cache (pronounced “cash”) is a collection of items stored somewhere for use at a later time. For example, a weapons cache is a place where weapons are kept until they are needed.

In computers, a cache is a set of computer memory where data can be stored for later use. One of the most common uses for a cache in computers relates to situations where there is a significant time delay in acquiring certain data. In order to provide a faster user experience, the computer will store the data in a cache after the first time that data is used in order to avoid having to read the data from a slower device or without having to dig around in the computer to find the information again.

Files that you view from a cache may only take 2 or 3 seconds to display on your screen, while something new could take 30 seconds to be acquired, prepared for display and then displayed.

## Clearing the Cache
[Jump Back](#contents)

Whenever you enter a URL into the browser's address bar, you are making a request to the web server that is hosting the website for a specific file. This file may be an HTML document or a combination of files.

It takes time for the browser to load this content (it often downloads many files in order to reconstruct the webpage). To reduce the load time for future visits, the browser may store some of these pages as snapshots into its memory. This action is called “caching” and each snapshot is called a “cache file.” The next time you visit the same website, your browser may attempt to load up the cached files to reduce the load time. While this is useful for speed, occasionally websites do not display correctly due to corrupted or outdated data in the cache.

You may run a file or visit a site and see errors.

To ensure you’re viewing the correct and newest version of a website, you can clear your cache.

There are different ways to clear the cache, depending on the browser you’re using. Simply Google *“clear cache ______(browser name).”* For Google Chrome, you can click `CTRL+F5`.

This is mentioned here as a troubleshooting tip for web pages that aren’t displaying properly.
