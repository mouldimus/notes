# HTML Concepts
In here I'll do my best to explain HTML concepts, keywords and phrases.

## Reserved Words and Keywords
[Jump Back](#contents)

In most programming languages, there are certain words you can’t use as variables, labels (names assigned to sections of code), or functions (repeatable blocks of code). These are called reserved words. For example, in the popular programming language Python, `def` (which defines a function) and `if` (which creates an if statement) are reserved words.

The reason you cannot use these words is that they already mean something else – they are reserved for the programming language.

And so, if you were creating a variable in Python, you couldn’t write:
```python
if = 10
```
because `if` already means something in Python.

Reserved words are also called keywords (again, code built into the syntax of a language is the keywords of that language).

## Cache

A cache (pronounced “cash”) is a collection of items stored somewhere for use at a later time. For example, a weapons cache is a place where weapons are kept until they are needed.

In computers, a cache is a set of computer memory where data can be stored for later use. One of the most common uses for a cache in computers relates to situations where there is a significant time delay in acquiring certain data. In order to provide a faster user experience, the computer will store the data in a cache after the first time that data is used in order to avoid having to read the data from a slower device or without having to dig around in the computer to find the information again.

Files that you view from a cache may only take 2 or 3 seconds to display on your screen, while something new could take 30 seconds to be acquired, prepared for display and then displayed.
