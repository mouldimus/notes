# Troubleshooting Methods
Here are a couple of methods of troubleshooting issues in computer programming.

- [Breaking Down the Program](#breaking-down-the-program)
- [When creating a new program](#when-creating-a-new-program)


## The Half Split Method: 
- modulise your work
- check the desire output after each module
- if correct you can assume the module is correct and move onto the next module
- if not check these things
	1. source who created it
	2. when was it last modified, does it corelate with when there started being issues
	3. test
	4. modulise the module, keep splitting and repeat the process

## Breaking Down the Program: 
Build the program in it's individual steps the computer will have to take
- This modulisation will help with troubleshooting and testing later
- As you get more expierenced you'll be able to build it with multiple steps at once

## When creating a new program, 
- watch and learn from how the current system works
- ask questions on things that bother them
- try it out yourself
- Then start working on a solution to the problems
