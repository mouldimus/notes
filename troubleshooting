The Half Split Method: 
	- modulise your work
	- check the desire output after each module
	- if correct you can assume the module is correct and move onto the next module
	- if not check these things
		* source who created it
		* when was it last modified, does it corelate with when there started being issues
		* test
		* modulise the module, keep splitting and repeat the process

Breaking Down the Program: 
	- Build the program in it's individual steps the computer will have to take
		* This modulisation will help with troubleshooting and testing later
		* As you get more expierenced you'll be able to build it with multiple steps at once

When creating a new program, 
	- watch and learn from how the current system works
	- ask questions on things that bother them
	- try it out yourself
	- Then start working on a solution to the problems
